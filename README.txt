shortcut command

About this command: This GitHub repo is the first complete script I wrote in Bash. The purpose is to be able to move to specific directorys in my filesystem without typing out their long file name or navigating slowly with cd. 

How it works: I do this by creating a bookmark system where absolute path is stored with shortcut names in file shortcutData. I include a number of other features like creating new shortcuts, deleting shortcuts, and a help page.

Important: This is not a plug and play command. On my computer it is in a directory on my path and the other files are in a document folder. To get it working on your machine you will have to set it up and change the script. At some point I want to update the script to make it easier to download and use.
